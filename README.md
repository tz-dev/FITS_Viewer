# FITS Viewer

A lightweight tool for viewing and navigating FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, built with Python and Tkinter. This tool dynamically loads and displays tabular data from FITS files, especially suited for large datasets like `specObj-dr17.fits` from the SDSS.

## Features

- **Dynamic Loading:** Columns are automatically loaded from the FITS file, with no hardcoded columns in the code.
- **Navigation:** Previous/Next page with mouse or buttons.
- **Jump to:** Jump to any page for quicker navigation.
- **Mousewheel Support:** Navigate pages via scroll wheel.
- **Customization:** Adjust font size, column width, rows & columns to display.
- **Status:** Shows current page, total rows, and displayed rows.
- **Memory-Efficient:** Uses `memmap=True` to handle large files.
